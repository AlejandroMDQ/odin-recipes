        <h2 class="sub-heading">What are the burritos? Lets know it!</h2>
        <p>A burrito is a dish in mexican and tex-mex cuisine that took form in California cuisine, <em>consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape and various ingredients</em>. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients togheter. Burritos can also be served "wet", i. e., covered in a savoury and spice sauce, when they would be eaten with a fork and knife.</p>
